Bubble Tabs
===================

A plugin that moves the selected tab to the first position.  
So you'll always get the most recent used tab on the first index, the second on the second, etc.

## Instalation
Clone/copy/download and put in packages folder

##Usage
Just open a few tabs and watch how the active is always on the first position.

## HELP
Don't know how to put on package manager :(
